Installation:
==========
No need to install.  Simply run that bash script.  Without arguments, it will list all of the available themes.  Pick one, and run the script with the theme as the first argument.  (That's "script_name theme_nickname" for those of you not paying attention.)
This only works for the linux console or framebuffer consoles.  It was not designed to work inside of X.
